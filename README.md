ETL Process in Detail
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. Itâ€™s a fundamental process in data engineering and analytics to move and reshape data from source systems to target systems for analysis, reporting, or further processing.

Extract: Retrieve raw data from various data sources such as databases, APIs, flat files (CSV, JSON, etc.), or other data streams.
Transform: Cleanse, filter, aggregate, and manipulate the data to fit the needs of the target system. This step may involve data type conversions, calculations, enrichment, and validation.
Load: Store the transformed data into a destination system like a data warehouse, database, or data lake.
